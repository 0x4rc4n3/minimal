Metrics Logging Module

The system must log all metrics automatically to ensure accurate, unbiased, and reproducible research results. No manual input is allowed during logging.

1. Authentication Performance Metrics (Must Log)
    - Authentication method (TRADITIONAL / DID)
    - Anonymized session ID
    - Attempt number per session
    - Authentication start time
    - Authentication end time
    - Total authentication duration (milliseconds)
    - Authentication result (success / failure)

Instructions:
    - Log every attempt, including failed and abandoned ones.
    - Calculate duration on the server side.
    - Do not exclude retries.

2. Error and Failure Metrics (Must Log)
    - Error type (user error / system error)
    - Standardized error code (e.g., INVALID_PASSWORD, INVALID_SIGNATURE, USER_REJECTED)
    - Error message shown to the user
    - Authentication method linked to the error

Instructions:
    - Each failure must map to one clear error code.
    - Errors must be logged even if the user retries immediately.

3. Usability and Interaction Metrics (Must Log)
    - Number of attempts before success
    - Retry count per method
    - Drop-off indicator (no successful login in session)
    - Method abandonment indicator
    - Time spent on method-specific education screen

Instructions:
    - Track usability metrics per session.
    - Do not reset counters until the session ends.

4. User Feedback Metrics (Must Log)
    - Ease of use rating (1–5)
    - Perceived speed rating (1–5)

    - Willingness to use again (Yes/No or Percentage)
    - Optional free-text comments

Instructions:
    - Collect feedback immediately after each method.
    - Link feedback to session, not to personal identity.

5. Security-Relevant Metrics (Must Log)
    - Nonce reuse attempts
    - Expired nonce usage
    - Invalid or mismatched signatures
    - Multiple failed attempts within a short time window

Instructions:
    - Log security events separately from usability errors.
    - Do not store cryptographic secrets or raw signatures.

6. Session-Level Metrics (Must Log)
    - First authentication method used
    - Order of methods completed
    - Total session duration
    - Session completion status (completed / abandoned)

Instructions:
    - Use session-level data to analyze order bias and learning effects.
    - Maintain full session history for analysis.

7. Privacy and Ethics Constraints (Mandatory)
    - No passwords, private keys, or raw signatures may be stored.
    - All session identifiers must be anonymized.
    - Raw behavioral data must be processed into aggregate metrics before storage.

Instruction:
    - Logging must comply with ethical research standards and informed consent.

DID Login Module: System Architecture & Workflow

1. System Overview
The Decentralized Identity (DID) login module replaces traditional shared-secret authentication (passwords) with a "Dual-Stack" research platform utilizing a Challenge-Response mechanism. It leverages a custom browser extension as the identity provider and a Python Flask backend for cryptographic verification.

2. Technical Communication & Data Path
The process follows a strict flow to ensure zero-latency measurement and high-security assurance
1. Discovery Phase (Frontend ↔ Extension):
    - The React.js frontend detects the custom extension provider injected into `window`
    - User POV: User clicks "Login with Wallet".
    - Telemetry: The system triggers a millisecond-precision timer to measure "Time-on-Task"

2. Challenge Phase (Frontend ↔ Backend):
    - The Frontend sends the user's Public Ethereum Address to the Flask API
    - The Backend generates a cryptographically secure random "Nonce" (Number used once)
    - The Nonce is stored in the database and linked to the user's session to prevent replay attacks


3. Response Phase (Frontend ↔ Extension):
    - The Backend returns the Nonce to the Frontend
    - The Frontend invokes the extension to sign the Nonce using the private key (EIP-191 standard)
    - User POV: A popup appears; the user approves the "Sign Message" request

4. Verification Phase (Backend ↔ Database):
    - The signature is posted back to the `verify` endpoint
    - The Backend uses `web3.py` to recover the address from the signature and compares it with the address in the database
    - The Check: If `Recovered_Address == Public_Address`, the user is verified

5. User Experience (POV) & Result
    - Seamless Access: The user never types a password, reducing "Password Fatigue"
    - Security Assurance: Because the private key never leaves the extension, the account is immune to phishing attempts targeting static credentials
    - Session Conclusion: Upon success, a JWT is issued, and the user is redirected to the Student Dashboard
    - Research Data: The system logs final interaction metrics, including "Cognitive Hesitation Scores" based on mouse path deviation

6. Admin Protocol (Kiosk Mode)
To prepare for the next participant in a controlled lab environment, the Researcher triggers a "Reset"
    - Programmatically revokes extension permissions via `wallet_revokePermissions`
    - Clears local storage and session tokens to ensure a "clean" environment for the next user


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 Traditional Login Module: Control Group Architecture & Workflow

 1. System Overview
The Traditional Login Module serves as the "Baseline" or Control Group for the usability study. It utilizes a standard Shared-Secret architecture (Username/Password) to authenticate users against a centralized repository. This module is critical for quantifying "Password Fatigue" and provides the benchmark against which the DID pathway is measured.

 2. Technical Communication & Data Path
To ensure a fair "A/B Test," the data path follows a high-standard secure development lifecycle:

1. Initialization Phase (Frontend):
    - The React.js frontend presents a standardized, high-fidelity UI identical in theme and layout to the DID portal
   - User POV: User enters their University credentials (Username/Password).
    - Telemetry: The "Black Box" logging begins at the first keystroke or when the "Login" button is clicked to measure total input time

2. Security & Hashing (Backend ↔ Database):
    - The Frontend sends credentials over a secure channel to the Flask API
    - The Check: The Backend retrieves the Salted Hash associated with the username from the PostgreSQL `Users` table
    - Verification: The system uses a secure hashing algorithm (like Argon2 or BCrypt) to verify the password without storing the actual string

3. Telemetry & Interaction Monitoring:
    - The system records not just success, but User Errors (typos, forgotten passwords) and System Errors.
    - Cognitive Load: Mouse-path deviation and "idle-time-between-keystrokes" are recorded to measure hesitation.

4. Authorization Phase:
    - Upon verification, the Backend issues a JWT Session Token.
    - The Destination: User is redirected to the Dashboard.
    - Comparison Point: The system logs the final "time_taken_ms" into the `AuthLogs` table with the method label `TRADITIONAL` for statistical T-testing against the DID data.

 3. Research Significance (POV)
    - The Friction Point: This module captures the "Interaction Cost" of manual data entry, which is the primary drawback of traditional systems.
    - Threat Model: From a research POV, this module demonstrates the "Single Point of Failure"—if the database is compromised, all user secrets are exposed, unlike the DID pathway where no secrets are stored server-side.
    - Baseline Metadata: This path provides the necessary data to prove whether the "Sovereign Pathway" actually lowers IT helpdesk burdens (like password resets) in a university setting.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 Project Structure: User Experience & Page Architecture

From a research participant's perspective, the platform is structured as a "Linear Experimental Funnel." This ensures that data collection—from the initial consent to the final usability survey—follows a controlled, logical path[cite: 141, 151].

 1. Landing & Consent Page (The Entry)
    - Informational: Displays the research title, purpose of the study, and the Department of Cyber Security branding[cite: 424, 425].
    - Functional: Contains the Participant Consent Form[cite: 423, 435]. The user must check the "Agree" boxes to proceed to the testing environment[cite: 435, 436].

 2. Pathway Selection (The Router)
    - Informational: Briefly explains that the user will perform two different login tasks[cite: 428, 429].
    - Functional: Uses an A/B Testing module to assign the user to "Sequence A" (Traditional first) or "Sequence B" (Sovereign first) to prevent order bias[cite: 151].

 3. The Authentication Interface (The Core Test)
This page holds the "Dual-Stack" logic and changes its UI based on the active pathway[cite: 302, 341].

 Pathway A: Traditional Login
    - Informational: Standard fields for Username and Password[cite: 222, 260].
    - Functional: Captures keystroke timing and credential verification against the PostgreSQL database[cite: 257, 260].

 Pathway B: Sovereign Login (Your Custom Extension)
    - Informational: Visual cues for "Connect Wallet" and "Sign Message"[cite: 251, 326].
    - Functional: Interfaces with your browser extension provider to perform the ECDSA challenge-response handshake[cite: 224, 326].



 4. Post-Login Student Dashboard (Verification)
    - Informational: Confirms successful authentication with a "Welcome, [User]" message and displays session metadata (e.g., Auth Method used)[cite: 254, 359].
    - Functional: Holds the "Complete Task" button which signals the end of the timed telemetry session[cite: 371].

 5. Usability Evaluation Page (The Result)
    - Informational: Presents the 5-point Likert Scale questions[cite: 405].
    - Functional: Collects qualitative data on Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Security[cite: 406, 411]. Upon submission, the "Admin Reset Protocol" triggers to clear all session data for the next user[cite: 266, 418].

 Integrated System Architecture: DID & Traditional Research Pathways

This document outlines the professional architecture for a dual-stack research platform designed to empirically measure the usability of Decentralized Identity (DID) against traditional methods. By utilizing a pre-configured account and a mandatory "Admin Reset" between sessions, the study isolates recurring authentication friction.

 1. Project Page Architecture & Funnel
The platform follows a linear flow to ensure consistent data collection across 200 participants:

    - Landing Page: Displays institutional branding and the Participant Consent Form.
    - Pathway Router: Assigns users to "Sequence A" or "Sequence B" to prevent order bias in the A/B test.
    - The Auth Interface: The central testing node holding both the Traditional and Sovereign pathways.
    - Post-Login Dashboard: A standardized landing area that signals task completion and logs the final telemetry.
    - Usability Survey: Captures qualitative Likert-scale data on perceived ease of use and security.

 2. The Sovereign Pathway (Custom Extension)
This module uses a "Challenge-Response" mechanism to prove identity without passwords.

    - Origin (Frontend): React.js detects the custom provider and initiates the "Time-on-Task" timer.
    - The Challenge (Backend): Flask generates a unique Nonce and stores it in Database
    - The Response (Extension): The user signs the Nonce with a private key inside the extension using EIP-191.
    - Verification: The Backend recovers the address via web3.py; if it matches the stored address, access is granted.
    - User POV: Interaction is limited to a "Connect" and "Sign" popup, removing the need for manual data entry
 3. The Traditional Pathway (Control Group)
This module acts as the scientific baseline for all interaction metrics.

    - Input Handling: Standard Username/Password fields capture keystrokes and timing.
    - Backend Check: Flask verifies the input against salted hashes in the centralized database.
    - Interaction Friction: Specifically measures the "cost" of password recall and typing errors


 4. Telemetry & Analytics Engine
This "Black Box" module silently logs high-frequency data for statistical analysis:

    - Metric 1: Task Completion Time (milliseconds) from start to success
    - Metric 2: Cognitive Hesitation Score derived from mouse path deviation and idle time
    - Metric 3: Error Classification (e.g., USER_REJECTED vs. INVALID_CREDENTIALS)

 5. Admin Sanitization Protocol (Kiosk Mode)
To ensure every user starts from a "cold" state, the researcher triggers a reset after each session

    - Revocation: The system calls `wallet_revokePermissions` to force the extension to disconnect
    - Purge: LocalStorage and session tokens are cleared to prevent cached data from influencing speed
    - Result: The environment is sanitized, ensuring the next participant must perform the handshake manually.
